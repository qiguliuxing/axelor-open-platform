title: Add S3-Compatible Object Storage
type: feature
description: |
  Added support for S3-compatible object storage for DMSFile/MetaFile.
  The default implementation remains disk storage, but it can be switched to an S3-compatible service by configuring the `data.object-storage.*` properties.
  This change introduces a storage abstraction layer (`FileStoreFactory`) that should be used instead of direct file system access to ensure compatibility with both storage types.
