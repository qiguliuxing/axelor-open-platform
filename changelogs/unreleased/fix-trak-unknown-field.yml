title: Fix generateCode task spurious warning "track unknown field"
type: fix
description: |
  When defining an entity in xml, extending an entity not available in project source (defined in dependencies),
  that super entity was not available in lookup and caused spurious warning "track unknown field".

  Now make sure to compute lookup for any super classes if not present.
