title: Deprecate `TagSelect` widget in favor of `Tags`.
type: change
description : |
  `TagSelect` widget is deprecated in favor of `Tags`. It has the same behavior, itâ€™s just a renaming of the widget 
  name for readability and relevance. Old name can still be used, but we encourage adopting the new name as its usage 
  will be removed in a next version.
