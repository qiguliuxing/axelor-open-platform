title: Switch to Shiro native sessions
type: change
description: |
  We have switched from servlet-container sessions to Shiro native sessions. This change enables the use of Redis/Valkey server as a session store and simplifies the overall architecture by leveraging Shiro's `SessionDAO`.

  Key changes to be aware of:

  * By default, the session manager now uses a memory-only `MemoryConstrainedCacheManager`. This means that sessions are not persisted between application restarts.
  * `HttpSessionListener` is no longer used. Instead, you can access active sessions via `AuthSessionService.getActiveSessions()` which uses the `SessionDAO`.

  For more details about Shiro's session management, see the https://shiro.apache.org/session-management.html[Shiro Session Management documentation].
