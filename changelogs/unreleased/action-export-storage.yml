title: Rework axelor-export storage
type: feature
description: |
  Exported files are now created as a temporary files instead of being saved to `data.export.dir` directory.
  It used to be possible to disable downloading and have exported files only accessible in `data.export.dir` directory.
  This is no longer the case: the export files have to be either downloaded or attached to current record.

  - Add `attachment="true|false"` attribute to attach the exported file to current object.
  - Remove `output` attribute.
