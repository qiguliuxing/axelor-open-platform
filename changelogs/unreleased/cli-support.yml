title: Add application bundle & CLI support
type: feature
description: |
  The command line support can be used to implement custom commands
  to perform various tasks. The command line runner will locate
  `CliCommand` instances using service loader interface. A `database`
  command is added to perform various database related tasks.
  
  The Gradle plugin adds a new task `buildApp` to build application
  distribution. The application bundle will be generated at
  `build/install/{project-name}` folder which includes extracted war
  application in the `app/` directory, launcher script dependencies in
  the `lib/` directory and executable scripts in the `bin/` directory.
  
  The `axelor` script is an executable command line tool that can be used
  to execute various commands provided by the app: `./bin/axelor --help`
  for more details.
