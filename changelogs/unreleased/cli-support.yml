title: Add command line support
type: feature
description: |
  The axelor apps now has command line support.
  
  A new gradle task `buildApp` is added to create application bundle
  with command line support.
  
  The bundle will be generated at `build/axelor-app` which includes
  extracted war application and an executable `axelor.jar` to execute
  various commands.
  
  The app modules can provide additional commands by implementing
  `com.axelor.app.cli.CliCommand` or more conveniently by extending
  `com.axelor.app.cli.AbstractCliCommand` which provide helper methods
  to execute tasks inside container or persistence sessions.
  
  The core module includes `run` and `database` commands which can be
  used to run the application or perform database maintenance tasks.
