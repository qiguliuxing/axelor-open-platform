title: Re-implemented audit traking/fields support
type: change
description: |
  The old Interceptor based implementation has several limitations and couldn't work
  in cases where persistence session is created manually.

  The new implementation uses event listener api and thus can have access to the session
  for which the events are fired. Fixing, issues caused by persistent session created
  manually.
  
  Also, new api handles multi-threading cases more effectively.
