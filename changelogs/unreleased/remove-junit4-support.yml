title: Remove Junit4 support
type: change
description : |
  JUnit 4 is no longer actively maintained, and the last maintenance release was JUnit 4.13.2 in February 2021. Support 
  for JUnit Jupiter (JUnit 5) was introduced in v6.0. It is time to drop support for JUnit 4. Migrate your Junit tests 
  to Junit5.
