title: Re-implement run and database gradle tasks
type: feature
description: |
  Re-implemented `run` and `database` gradle tasks as `JavaExec` tasks.
  This allows to run them with vscode java debugger.
  
  Also, as gradle support in all major IDEs are now matured, the `run`
  task should be the preferred way to debug axelor apps.
