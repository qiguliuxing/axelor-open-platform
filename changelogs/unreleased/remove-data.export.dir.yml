title: Remove `data.export.dir` setting
type: remove
description: |
  Another consequence of supporting multiple storage providers
  is the removal of export directory setting `data.export.dir`.
  If you used it, you should migrate your code to create temporary files
  or directories instead, using `com.axelor.file.temp.TempFiles`,
  then download or attach the files somewhere for the users to access.

  Related ActionExport#getExportPath is also removed.
