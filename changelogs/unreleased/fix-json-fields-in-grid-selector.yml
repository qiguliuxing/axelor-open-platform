title: Allow selecting all custom fields when customizing grid columns
type: fix
description: |
  When there are no custom fields in original grid view, all custom fields visible in grid are added to view.

  But in the case when there is at least one custom field defined in original view, only that custom field was listed 
  in grid customization selector. Now all custom fields are listed, even those who aren't checked are visible in grid.
