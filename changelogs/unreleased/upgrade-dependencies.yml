title: Upgrade backend dependencies
type: change
description: |
  Here is the list of backend dependencies upgraded :

  * Upgrade to Guice 7 (Jakarta EE 9)
  * Upgrade Hibernate from 5.6.x to 6.6.29.Final
  * Upgrade BIRT from 4.4.2 to 4.21.0

  Many of your reports will likely have rendering changes or may even be broken due to numerous emitter improvements/changes in BIRT.

  `IPDFRenderOption.PDF_HYPHENATION` is renamed to `IPDFRenderOption.PDF_WORDBREAK`, but enabled by default.

  BIRT has transitive dependency to Apache POI, upgraded from 3.9 to 5.4.0, that includes **breaking** changes:

  Also, the XML parser in BIRT has become more strict. Most notably, in your `fontsConfig.xml`,
  you need to omit the DOCTYPE declaration `<!DOCTYPE font>` to avoid validation against a non-existent DTD.
  Otherwise, your font configuration file will fail validation and will be ignored.
