title: Upgrade Shiro from 1.13.0 to 2.0.3
type: change
description: |
  Use Shiro 2 default hash algorithm: argon2id

  To migrate passwords to the more secure algorithm, you can force users with old hashes
  to change their passwords:

  ```sql
  UPDATE auth_user SET force_password_change = TRUE WHERE password LIKE '$shiro1$%';
  ```

  When users set their new passwords, the new hash algorithm will be used.
