type: feature
description: |
  Introduced Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) as an optional security feature to enhance user account protection.
  Supported MFA methods: 
    - TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) via authenticator apps.
    - Email verification codes (with 5-minute validity)
    - Recovery codes as backup authentication method
  Users can configure, test, and enable MFA from their preferences, select a default MFA method, and
  are prompted for a second-factor code during login once MFA is activated.
