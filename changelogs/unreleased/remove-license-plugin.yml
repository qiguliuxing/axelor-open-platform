title: Remove built-in license header support
type: remove
description: |
  As part of the AxelorPlugin, we historically provided built-in support to manage license headers. This support has been
  removed and `licenseFormat`, `licenseCheck` and related tasks no longer exist. The plugin on which support was provided
  is no longer maintained. This is now application or module responsibility to provide it.
  
  There are many Gradle plugins that can do the job. [List](https://plugins.gradle.org/search?term=license+header) is
  available on the Gradle plugin portal. The awesome [Spotless](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.diffplug.gradle.spotless) 
  formatting plugin provides support for adding license headers.
