title: Add checkDuplicateClasses gradle task
type: feature
description: |
  Added a new `checkDuplicateClasses` gradle task to detect conflicting dependencies in application projects.
  
  The task analyzes runtime classpath dependencies and identifies duplicate classes between different
  jar files, helping to prevent classpath conflicts that can cause runtime issues.

  Key features:
  - Automatically excludes Axelor modules (which can have duplicate domain classes by design)
  - Supports exclude patterns for specific libraries
