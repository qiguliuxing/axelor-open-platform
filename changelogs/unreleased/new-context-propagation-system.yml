title: Implement new context propagation system across threads and tasks submission
type: feature
description: |
  The new context propagation system is used to propagate context across threads and tasks submission. This is an all
  in one system combining `TenantAware` and `AuditableRunner` behaviors.

  Main issue is to propagate in threads and tasks all information's coming from HTTP requests (only available in
  servlet environments). Are concerned : the current user, tenant, locale, language and base URL. Some can be
  determined by application properties, some logic can be dependent from the request. The system is now able to propagate
  all current context information in threads and tasks. It also allows manually defining them in (case of scheduling /
  batching).

  `ContextAwareRunnable` or `ContextAwareCallable` can be used to propagate context
  information.

  Usage :
  ```java
  ContextAware.of()
  .withTransaction(true) // true by default
  .withUser(AuthUtils.getUser("admin"))
  .withTenantId(myTenant)
  .build(
    () -> {
      // Task code here
    }
  )
  .run()
  ```
