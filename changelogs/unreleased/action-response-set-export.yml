title: Implement token-based download for ActionResponse#setExport
type: change
description: |
  Data export process now requires a token param instead of a file path relative to the export directory.
  ActionResponse#setExport has been updated and overloaded accordingly:

  - `ActionResponse#setExport(String path)`
  - `ActionResponse#setExport(String path, String name)`
  - `ActionResponse#setExport(Path path, String name)`
  - `ActionResponse#setExport(Path path, String name)`
  - `ActionResponse#setExport(InputStream stream, String name)`

  The file path is copied to a dedicated temporary file for pending export.
  `path` filename is used for download name if `name` is not specified as second parameter.
