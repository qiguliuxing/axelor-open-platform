title: Fix saving of custom attrs items in grid customization
type: fix
description: |
  Custom attrs fields/buttons that were auto-added were not properly processed
  when saving customization.

  This fixes preserving and removing of those fields.

  When saved, all custom fields are explicitly present as view items.
