title: Implement new Fixture api
type: feature
description: |
  The new `Fixture` api provides a more clean yaml format.

  For example:

  ```yaml
  - type: User      # model
    key: user:admin # unique key
    properties:
      name: Some Name
      code: admin
      role: role:1  # reference key
      groups:
        - group:1   # reference key
        - group:2   # reference key
  ```

  - `type` is the model name.
  - `key` is a unique key for the fixture record.
  - `properties` contains the fields of the model.

  The relationships are defined using reference keys.
