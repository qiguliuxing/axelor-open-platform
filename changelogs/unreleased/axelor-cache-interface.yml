title: Add AxelorCache caching interface supporting distributed caching
type: feature
description: |
  The `AxelorCache` interface wraps various cache implementations.

  Supported implementations include:
    - Caffeine (in-memory)
    - Redisson (Redis/Valkey)

  The underlying implementation that is used depends on application configuration.

  Usage example:

  ```java
  private static final AxelorCache<String, Action> ACTIONS =
      CacheBuilder.newBuilder("actions").maximumSize(1000).weakValues().build(XMLViews::findAction);
  ```

  Added `DistributedFactory`, which is a utility class that facilitates concurrency control in distributed cache environments.
  It provides static methods to access distributed-aware synchronization primitives, such as locks and atomic longs.
