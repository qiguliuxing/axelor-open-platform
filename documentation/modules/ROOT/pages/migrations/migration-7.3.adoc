:gradle-8-0-8-7: https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/upgrading_version_8.html

In this document, we will see the major steps to migrate from 7.2 to 7.3.

NOTE: Please check the {product-version-changelog}[change log] for detailed list of fixes, changes and improvements introduced in 7.3

== Dependencies upgrade

Some dependencies have been upgraded to newer versions. Check the {product-version-changelog}[change log] for detailed
list.

Gradle has also been upgraded to a newer version. Upgrade the Gradle Wrapper to benefit from new features and
improvements : `./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version 8.11.1`.

[NOTE]
====
Note that running the wrapper task once will update `gradle-wrapper.properties` only, but leave the wrapper itself in
`gradle-wrapper.jar` untouched. This is usually fine as new versions of Gradle can be run even with ancient wrapper
files. If you nevertheless want all the wrapper files to be completely up-to-date, youâ€™ll need to run the `wrapper`
task a second time.
====

Check Gradle migration to update your builds : {gradle-8-0-8-7}[Upgrading your build from Gradle 8.x to the latest]

NOTE: The workaround previously suggested for Gradle issue "javaToolchains incorrectly reports 'does not contain a java executable' on Debian and Ubuntu" (xref:migrations/migration-7.1.adoc#dependencies-upgrade[described in 7.1 migration guide]) is no longer needed since Gradle 8.8. If you had implemented this workaround, you can safely remove it.

[#help-widget-variant-support]
== Help widget variant support

The help variant is extracted from the `css` attributes values. Now, help widget has a new attribute `variant` that
can be used, `css` attribute usage to determinate the variant is deprecated. Accepted values are `info`, `success`,
`warning` and `error`. Default value is `info`.

[cols="2"]
|===
| Old `css` attribute values | `variant` equivalent
| `alert-info` | `info`
| `alert-success` | `success`
| `alert-warning` | `warning`
| `alert-danger` | `danger`
|===

== Add/edit/delete support in dashlet and panel-dashlet

This adds support for adding and deleting records on dashboard dashlets and panel-dashlet. It is not enable by default :
specify `canNew` and `canDelete` to `true` or with an expression evaluated against current context.

It also adds support to editable grids. The linked grid view should have `editable="true"` to allow edit records in
grids. To disable this behavior, you have to pass `canEdit="false"` to disable editable support without updating the
linked grid view.

== Label legacy css classes support

Built-in classes `label-warning`, `label-important`, `label-\{variant\}`, ... that automatically applied background
color have been removed. Now `label-\{variant\}` class only change text color. In order to apply background color, use
`label-bg-\{variant\}` class like `label-bg-warning`. Such classes are commonly used in custom views or in viewers. Do
appropriate changes if background color is needed.

As part of these changes, `dms.tag.style.selection` selection values has been updated. You need to run following sql
query in order to update the database values :

```sql
UPDATE dms_file_tag SET style = CONCAT ('label-bg-', SPLIT_PART(style, '-', 2))  WHERE style LIKE 'label-%';
```
