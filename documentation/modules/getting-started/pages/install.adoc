In this chapter we will see how to prepare the development environment on Linux and Windows
operating systems for working with {page-component-title} sources.

== Prerequisite

* {url-jdk}[OpenJDK 21]
* {url-postgresql}[PostgreSQL 12.0] or later
* Your favourite IDE
  ** xref:eclipse.adoc[Eclipse 2021-06] or later
  ** xref:idea.adoc[Intellij IDEA 2021.2] or later

== OpenJDK

On Linux/MacOS, install OpenJDK 21 and make sure JDK command line tools are in your path.
If you use distribution provided OpenJDK, they are already available in `PATH` otherwise do this:

[source,sh]
----
$ export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/jdk
$ export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
----

On Windows, the JDK installer generally configures `PATH` environment.
However, you can do following to setup `PATH` manually.

[source,batch]
----
$ set JAVA_HOME=\path\to\jdk
$ set PATH=%JAVA_HOME%\bin;%PATH%
----

To ensure, JDK is installed properly, try this command from console:

[source,sh]
----
$ javac -version
----

NOTE: See the list of well known {url-jdk-more}[JDK distributions].

== PostgreSQL

See {url-postgresql}[PostgreSQL] download page for more detailed information about installation process.

You may also require to configure postgresql server to allow

.Example pg_hba.conf
[source,apache]
----
# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD

# "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
local   all             all                                     trust
# IPv4 local connections:
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            md5
# IPv6 local connections:
host    all             all             ::1/128                 md5
