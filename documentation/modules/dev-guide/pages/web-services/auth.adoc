= Auth Services

:toc-title:

Web services support two authentication methods:

1. Session-based authentication
2. API key authentication

== Session-based authentication

Session-based authentication requires the client application to keep track of session ID and cookies between requests.

The session can be established with login services:

== Login

.Request
----
POST /callback HTTP/1.1
----

.Header
----
Content-Type: application/json
----

.Body
[source,json]
----
{
  "username": "admin",
  "password" : "secret"
}
----

The authentication data is sent in the body of the request.

Returns response with HTTP status `200` if login success otherwise returns
HTTP status `401`.

Only relevant headers and request body is shown.

== Logout

.Request
[source]
----
GET /logout HTTP/1.1
----

The login response returns session cookies which should be tracked by client
application.

Some libraries that can keep track of sessions:

* http://requests.ryanmccue.info/[Request for PHP]
* http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/[Request for Python]
* https://github.com/request/request[Request for NodeJS]
* http://hc.apache.org/[Apache HTTP Client (Java)]

== API key authentication

API key authentication allows clients to authenticate API requests without maintaining a session. This is particularly useful for server-to-server communication and automated scripts.

=== Managing API keys

API keys are managed by the `com.axelor.auth.db.UserToken` object. Each user can have multiple API keys with different names and expiration dates.

==== Creating API keys

API keys can be created from the User Preference form. To create a new API key:

1. Checkout "Manage API key?"
2. Click "Add" to create a new API key
3. Provide a name
4. Set an expiration date (default is one month from creation)
5. Click "Create API key"

IMPORTANT: When a new API key is created, it will be displayed only once. Make sure to copy and store it securely as you won't be able to view it again later.

==== Managing existing API keys

The API Keys tab displays a list of all tokens for the user with the following information:

* Name: A descriptive name for the token
* Expiration date: When the token will expire
* Last used: The last time the token was used for authentication

The system provides visual indicators for token expiration:
* *Red highlight*: For expired tokens
* *Yellow highlight*: For tokens expiring within 7 days

==== Token operations

For each token, you can perform the following operations:

* *Revoke*: Permanently disables the token. Any services using this token will immediately lose access.
* *Rotate*: Replaces the token with a new one while maintaining the same name and expiration date. This is useful when you suspect a token might have been compromised.

IMPORTANT: API keys should be treated as sensitive information. Do not share your API keys and store them securely.

=== Using API keys for authentication

To authenticate using an API key, include the API key in the `API-KEY` HTTP header with each request:

.Request with API Key Authentication
----
GET /ws/path
----

.Header
----
API-KEY: <your-api-key>
----

The API key authentication does not create a session, so each request must include the API-KEY header.

=== API key validation

All API requests are authenticated through the following security checks:

1. Key validation
* Verifies the structure and presence of the API key
* Authenticates the key against stored credentials

2. Validity checks
* Checks if the API key hasn't expired
* Confirms the associated user account is active

If any of these checks fail, the request is rejected with HTTP status `401 Unauthorized`.
