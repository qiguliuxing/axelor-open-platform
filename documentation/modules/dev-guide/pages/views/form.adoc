= Form View
:toc:
:toc-title:

The form view shows a single record in form layout. It's the main view to see
a record with details.

Form view has two modes:

* `readonly` - mode shows fields values as html text
* `editable` - mode shows field editors with values

A form view is defined like this:

[source,xml]
-----
<form name="contact-form"
      title="Contact"
      model="com.axelor.contact.db.Contact"> <1>
  <panel name="overviewPanel" title="Overview"> <2>
    <field name="fullName" readonly="false"> <3>
      <editor> <4>
        <field name="title" colSpan="3"/>
        <field name="firstName" colSpan="4"/>
        <field name="lastName" colSpan="5"/>
      </editor>
    </field>
    <field name="dateOfBirth" />
    <field name="email">

<1> form view for the given domain model
<2> panel to group relevant fields
<3> an input field bound to the given model
<4> an editor can be used to define custom editor for the field
<5> a viewer can be used to define custom template to display field value
<6> a panel-related can be used to show o2m/m2m fields
<7> a panel to show in the right sidebar

The form uses responsive layout that adjusts according to the available screen
size. The form is divided into 12 columns. The first 8 columns are used to place
main panels and the rest 4 columns are used to place the sidebar panels.
If sidebar panels are not provided the normal panels will occupy all the 12
columns.

<panel-stack showIf="color">
  <panel title="Page 1" showIf="color == 'black'"/>
  <panel title="Page 2" showIf="color == 'white'"/>
  <panel title="Page 3" showIf="color == 'gray'"/>
</panel-stack>
-----

=== Panel Related

A `panel-related` is used to put o2m/m2m fields. It shows a separate panel bellow
the normal panels with a grid widget having fields defined inside.

It includes all `panel` and `relational` attributes except for `itemSpan`.
A `panel-related` includes the following attributes:

[cols="2,8"]

IMPORTANT: With `canMove`, sequencing is done on field specified by `orderBy`, and it must be only one integer field. If not specified, not sequencing is done.
On one-to-many/many-to-many grids, `orderBy` is required with `canMove`, except for dummy fields.

[source,xml]

<panel-related field="addresses">
  <!-- grid widgets -->
</panel-related>

<panel-dashlet action="chart:chart.sales.per.month"/>
-----

== Panel Widgets

The `panel` can use the following widgets:

* `menu` - define a custom menu for the panel
* `field` - binds a model field, automatically selects appropriate widget
* `spacer` - can be used to skip a cell
* `separator` - can be used to define a boundary
* `label` - can be used to set a static label (prefer `static`)
* `static` - can be used to show static text (preferred over `label`)
* `help` - can be used to show static help information
* `button` - a button widget that executes some action
* `button-group` - group of buttons
* `panel` - an embedded panel
* `panel-dashlet` - an embedded panel-dashlet
* `panel-include` - an embedded panel-include
* `panel-related` - an embedded panel-related

The field has few properties, but most common of them are:

* `name` - name of the widget
* `hidden` - whether the widget is hidden
* `readonly` - whether the widget is readonly
* `required` - whether the field is required

== Dummy fields

Form view can have dummy fields. These fields are not bound to any of the model
fields but used to provide additional context.

Dummy fields can be specified like:

[source,xml]
----
<!-- string field if type is not specified -->
<field name="some" />
<!-- integer field, prefixed with $ to avoid dirty flag -->
<field name="$another" type="integer" min="1" max="100" />

<!-- relational fields -->
<field name="some" type="many-to-one"
  x-target="com.axelor.contact.db.Contact"
  x-target-name="fullName" />
----

Dummy field can also have `x-dirty="false` attribute to avoid dirty flag on the form when
that field is updated.

The legacy way is to prefix field name with `$`. The rules are :

* in server side, setting the dummy field value, use `$` prefix but when accessing the dummy field value,
don't use `$` prefix.
* in client side, always accessing the dummy field value with the `$` prefix.

[source,xml]
----
<!-- avoid dirty flag, using `x-dirty="false"` attribute
or prefix the field name with `$` -->
<field name="some" x-dirty="false"/>
<field name="$another" type="integer"/>
----

NOTE: The legacy dirty checking behavior of the `$` prefixed fields is now deprecated and is scheduled to be removed.

== Field editor

We can define custom editor for fields using `<editor>` child element on a field.

[source,xml]
----
<!-- editor for a computed field -->
<field name="fullName">
  <editor>
    <field name="title" />
    <field name="firstName" />
    <field name="lastName" />
  </editor>
</field>

<!-- editor for a many-to-one field -->
<field name="customer">
  <editor x-viewer="true">
    <field name="firstName" />
    <field name="lastName" />
    <field name="email" />
  </editor>
</field>

<!-- editor for a one-to-many field -->
<field name="emails">
  <editor layout="table" onNew="compute-default-email">
    <field name="email" />
    <field name="primary" widget="toggle" x-icon="star" x-icon-active="star-fill" x-exclusive="true" />
    <field name="optOut" widget="toggle" x-icon="ban" />
    <field name="invalid" widget="toggle" x-icon="exclamation-circle-fill" />
  </editor>
</field>

----

The `editor` can have the following properties:

* `layout` - alternative layout (`panel` (default) or `table`)
* `onNew` - an action to call when creating new record (only for one-to-many editors)
* `x-viewer` - can be used to consider editor as viewer
* `x-show-titles` - whether to show titles on editor fields
* `x-show-on-new` - whether to show the editor when creating new record

The `toggle` widget is specifically created for one-to-many editors to set boolean flags on the record.
The `toggle` widget has following attributes:

* `x-icon` - the icon to show when field value is not set or `false`
* `x-icon-ative` - the icon to show when field value is `true`
* `x-exclusive` - if `true` than the field of only this line of o2m list can be `true`

The `editor` can use the following widgets:

* `field` - binds a model field, automatically selects appropriate widget
* `button` - a button widget that executes some action
* `spacer` - can be used to skip a cell
* `separator` - can be used to define a boundary
* `label` - can be used to set a static label
* `panel` - an embedded panel

== Field viewer

We can define custom viewer for fields using `<viewer>` child element on a field.

[source,xml]
----
<!-- custom viewer on a normal field -->
<field name="customer">
  <viewer><![CDATA[
    <>
      <strong>{fullName}</strong>
    </>
  ]]></viewer>
</field>

<!-- custom viewer on a many-to-one field -->
<field name="customer">
  <viewer depends="fullName,email"><![CDATA[
    <>
      <a href=`mailto:${email}`>{email}</a>
    </>
  ]]></viewer>
</field>

<!-- customer viewer on a one-to-many field -->
<field name="emails">
  <viewer><![CDATA[
    <>
      <a href={`mailto:${email}`}>{email}</a>
    </>
  ]]></viewer>
</field>
----

The viewer uses template to render the values.

If viewer uses fields not in current form view, they should be listed as a comma
seperated list of fields with `depends=""` attribute.

The viewer template can have following helper functions to render values:

* `$get(name)` - get the nested value
* `$moment(date)` - covert date value to `moment.js` instance
* `$number(value)` - convert text value to number
* `$image(fieldName)` - get image url for the given image field
* `$fmt(fieldName)` - get formated value of the given field

== Field tooltip

We can define a details template on a field to show extra information about the cell with mouse over.

[source,xml]
----
<field name="customer">
  <tooltip depends="fullName">
  <![CDATA[
    <>
      <strong>Name: </strong><span>{fullName}</span>
    </>
  ]]>
  </tooltip>
</field>
----
