= Files Storage

== Upload files

Used to store uploaded files.

=== File System

The file system object store is the easiest to get started with. This is also the default
implementation to store uploaded files.

It uses a file system (local or a mounted share) to store files. It can be configured using
the following property:

[source,properties]
----
# Storage path for uploaded files
data.upload.dir = {user.home}/.axelor/attachments
----

=== S3 Object Storage

Simple storage service (S3) is a cloud-based storage solution that can be used to store files.

It can be configured using the following properties:

[source,properties]
----
data.object-storage.enabled = true
data.object-storage.endpoint = 127.0.0.1:9000
data.object-storage.path-style = true
data.object-storage.secure = true
data.object-storage.access-key = my-access-key
data.object-storage.secret-key = my-secret-key
data.object-storage.bucket = files
data.object-storage.region =
data.object-storage.encryption =
data.object-storage.encryption-kms-key-id =
data.object-storage.storage-class =

data.object-storage.cache.enabled =
data.object-storage.cache.max-entries =
data.object-storage.cache.time-to-live =
data.object-storage.cache.clean-frequency =
----

[NOTE]
`access-key` and `secret-key` are used for setting credentials.
They may be optional depending on your S3 configuration.

|===
| Setting | Description | Default value

| enabled | Enable or disable object storage | false
| endpoint | URL of the S3 service such as 127.0.0.1:9000 |
| path-style | Set to true to use `host/bucket/object` style paths instead of `bucket.host/object` | false
| secure | Set to true to use secure connection (`https`) | true
| access-key | Access key (aka user ID) of an account in the S3 service |
| secret-key | Secret key (aka password) of an account in the S3 service |
| bucket | The bucket name; should follow these https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucketnamingrules.html[rules] |
| region | S3 region |
| encryption | Encryption mode: `SSE-S3` or `SSE-KMS` |
| encryption-kms-key-id | KMS key ID. Only needed when `SSE-KMS` in `encryption` |
| cache.enabled | Enable or disable S3 cache  | true
| cache.max-entries | Maximum number of entries in cache, -1 means unlimited  | 2000
| cache.time-to-live | Time-to-live of a cache entry, in seconds, -1 means unlimited | 600
| cache.clean-frequency | Number of hits from which the cache is cleaned, -1 means disabled  | 1000
|===

== Temp files

To deal with temporary files, the following property can be configured as a dedicated directory:

[source,properties]
----
# Storage path for temp files (defaults to `{java.io.tmpdir}/.axelor`)
data.upload.temp-dir = {user.home}/.axelor-temp
----

Then use `com.axelor.file.temp.TempFile` to deal with temporary files and directories:

[source,java]
----
// Create a temporary file
Path tempFile = TempFiles.createTempFile();

// Create a temporary directory
Path tempFile = TempFiles.createTempDir();
----

Files will be created under subdirectory `tmp_files` of `data.upload.temp-dir`.
