= Multi-Tenancy
:toc:
:toc-title:

{page-component-title} has https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitenancy[multi-tenancy] support.
The term multi-tenancy refers to a software architecture in which a single instance of software runs
on a server and serves multiple tenants. A tenant is a group of users who share common access with
specific privileges to the software instance.

So now, a single instance of Axelor app can serve multiple tenants (users, companies etc).

== Configuration

The default multi-tenancy implementation uses multiple databases per tenant and requires
configuration from `axelor-config.properties`.

The database configuration keys with format `db.<tenant-id>.<key>` is used to configure
database connections.

[source,properties]
----
# enable multi-tenancy
application.multi-tenancy = true <1>

db.default.visible = false <2>
db.default.driver = org.postgresql.Driver
db.default.ddl = update <3>
db.default.url = jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/open-platform-demo-db
db.default.user = axelor
db.default.password =

db.db1.name = DB1 <4>
db.db1.hosts = host1,host1:8080 <5>
db.db1.driver = org.postgresql.Driver
db.db1.url = jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/open-platform-demo-db1
db.db1.user = axelor
db.db1.password =

db.db2.name = DB2
db.db2.hosts = host2,host2:8080
db.db2.driver = org.postgresql.Driver
db.db2.url = jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/open-platform-demo-db2
db.db2.user = axelor
db.db2.password =

db.db3.name = DB3
db.db3.hosts = host3,host3:8080
db.db3.driver = org.postgresql.Driver
db.db3.url = jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/open-platform-demo-db3
db.db3.user = axelor
db.db3.password =
----
<1> required to enable multi-tenancy feature
<2> the default database should be invisible as it's a fallback
<3> only default database supports DDL operations, schema for other tenants should be created manually
<4> display name of the tenant
<5> host name based filter, users can only access one tenant in case of hosts match

The default tenant is required and used for all unauthenticated requests.

== Customization

We can override this default implementation by providing custom implementation of these two interfaces:

* `com.axelor.db.tenants.TenantConfig` - an interface to provide tenant connection config values
* `com.axelor.db.tenants.TenantConfigProvider` - an interface to obtain TenantConfig, may be from external resource

The `TenantConfigProvider` defines following methods to implement:

* `TenantConfig find(String tenantId)` - find a TenantConfig instance for the given tenant id
* `List<TenantConfig> findAll(String host)` - find all the TenantConfig for the given hostname

The custom implementation should be integrated from application module like this:

[source,java]
----
public class DemoModule extends AxelorModule {

    @Override
    protected void configure() {
        bind(TenantConfigProvider.class).to(MyTenantConfigProvider.class);
    }

}
----

It's up to the `MyTenantConfigProvider` to decide how to resolve tenants (may be using jdbc connection
to some external database).

== Multi-threading

Any multi-threaded or multi-process task, should run with a special helper `com.axelor.db.tenants.TenantAware`.

Suppose you have following code that executes a task using a separate background process:

[source,java]
.process task
----
final ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(numWorkers);
executor.submit(() -> {
  // work with database
});
----

It will not work as expected as the current tenant context is not available outside the current thread.

It can be fixed with following changes:

[source,java]
.tenant aware process task
-----
final ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(numWorkers);
executor.submit(new TenantAware(() -> {
  // work with database
}));
-----

Now the task will have the current tenant context.

IMPORTANT: The `TenantAware` thread will run the task inside a new transaction by default.
If this is not the expected behaviour, you can disable it with `.withTransaction(false)`
before starting the thread.

However, if the process is not started from a web request (directly or indirectly),
you have to pass the desired tenant id manually. Otherwise, it will assume a default tenant.

[source,java]
.tenant aware process task
-----
final ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(numWorkers);
executor.submit(new TenantAware(() -> {
  // work with database
})
.tenantId("some-tenant"));
-----

Same way, you have to change and tasks running in different threads:

[source,java]
.threaded task
-----
Thread task = new Thread(() -> {
  // work with database
});

task.start();
-----

should be changed to:

[source,java]
.tenant aware threaded task
-----
Thread task = new TenantAware(() -> {
  // work with database
});

task.start();
-----

The `TenantAware` is a subclass of `java.lang.Thread`.

IMPORTANT: if the thread or process is not started from a web request, we have to
set the tenant id manually somehow using `TenantAware#tenantId(String)` method.

== Authentication

Clients without session support (e.g. direct basic auth) should provide `X-Tenant-ID` header
with every request to select a tenant.

Clients with session support should send `X-Tenant-ID` header with login request.

== Limitations

Schema generation is disabled in multi-tenancy mode.
